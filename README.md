# IUVS Detector Particle Sensitivity
 This work continues previous work done by Jenna Lowe, David Gomez, and Majd Mayyasi.  The purpose is to characterize the particle sensitivity of the MAVEN IUVS instrument throughout the mission, identify particle impacts with the detector using IUVS data, and correlate these detections with the SEP instrument and known aurorae on Mars.
